A university project based on the subject CyberSecurity , where we had to examine a certain biological lab under work circumstances and conduct a full security review . 
The review is based on the network of all of the computers , the location of the assets , an architectural plan of the building and a detailed explanation of the day-to-day processes
happening in the lab . Taking into account all of these factors , we conduct a CyberSecurity review where we find out the Assets , the Vulnurabilities and potential Threats for each one of those as well as 
ranking each one individually and recommending procures for each one of the threats .
